# SVM Optimization Assignment

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation and optimization of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers using various kernels and hyperparameter tuning techniques.

## 📘 Project Overview

In this assignment, the focus is on:
- Applying SVMs on a given dataset
- Understanding and experimenting with kernel tricks (linear, polynomial, RBF)
- Performing hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Analyzing accuracy and model performance
- Visualizing decision boundaries (if applicable)

## 📁 Files

- `SVM_Optimization_Assignment.ipynb`: The main notebook containing code, outputs, and explanations for the SVM assignment.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Kernel Functions: Linear, Polynomial, RBF
- Hyperparameter Tuning (`C`, `gamma`, `degree`) using GridSearchCV
- Data preprocessing using `StandardScaler`
- Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries

- Python 3
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib / seaborn (if used for visualization)

## 🚀 Getting Started
